## Abstract
### Description
The algorithm will recommend a playlist based on a list of user's liked tracks using tracks' characteristics (to make an analysis of chords, notes, rate, frequency etc., and track's metadata (such as track's name, its artist, album, genre, etc.).
### Data used
The algorithm requires a data-set of different music compositions of different genres, pace and artists.
### Expectation
The implemented model should be capable of finding tracks similar to a couple of liked tracks.
