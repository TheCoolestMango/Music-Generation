Team (BS19-RO):	Anton Buguev,	Mirna Alnoukari,	Elizaveta Kovanova

## Abstract
### Description
The algorithm will recommend a playlist based on a list of user's liked tracks using tracks' characteristics (to make an analysis of chords, notes, rate, frequency etc., and track's metadata (such as track's name, its artist, album, genre, etc.).
### Data used
The algorithm requires a data-set of different music compositions of different genres, pace and artists.
### Expectation
The implemented model should be capable of finding tracks similar to a couple of liked tracks.

# Prerequisites
The algorithm is implemented in Python v3. Installation instruction can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\
Further libraries can be installed using ```pip```. Pip installation instruction can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
## Libraries
The following libraries are required to run code:
* Librosa: ```pip install librosa```
* Numpy: ``` pip install numpy```
