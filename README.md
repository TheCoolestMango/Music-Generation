## Abstract
### Description
We will implement a Deep Learning algorithm that will recommend a playlist based on a list of user's liked tracks.
### Data used
The algorithm requires tracks's characteristics and track's metadata (such as track's name, its artist, album, genre, etc.)
### Expectation
The implemented model should be capable of finding tracks similar to a couple of liked tracks.
